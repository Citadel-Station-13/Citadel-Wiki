##Being the People Person
As the Head of Personnel, you’re more likely to be the attention of the crew, unlike the higher ranking captain. Because of this, and your important job to cater to most crew members, your office is normally quite visible outside of cargo. Unlike most stations, Citadel station has left the busy work of running and commanding cargo to the Quartermaster, and as such, your jurisdiction falls primarily on assistants, botany, the bartender, and the cooks (not that many will listen to you). Even with this reduction in responsibility, you will still occasionally be met with other department workers seeking job changes. 

Your office, surrounded primarily with reinforced walls, being only accessible by you and the captain, and a state of the art shutter system, will have you finding your job inside this fortress quite safe. The shutters can ward off evildoers, and even contain the rowdiest of clowns if they made the terrible decision to sit in line. Along with this, your locker contains an energy gun, an armor vest, zip ties, a door remote dedicated to civilian doors, and a flash. You also begin the shift with a telebaton and a tablet.

##Can We Really Call it HR Anymore? (Or, How to do Your Job)

#ID console

As the access monkey, your job is to hand out job changes and accept or deny further access to crew members IDs. Some of these requests come from wanting to do their job easier, while others maybe for more nefarious reasons. You are also at call by other heads of staff to aid in demoting troublemakers from their previous jobs.

Using the ID console is quite easy, you will need to put in an ID with access to ID changes into the console (normally your own ID, or one you’ve special made to use for this purpose), then insert the ID of the other party’s. After logging in, you will find a screen with registered name (normally the crew member’s name), assignment (an easy and fast way of changing job access by clicking on the desired job), and Access (specific types of access that the ID can operate, red being the ones granted to the ID). 

Job changes are as easy as selecting the requested job and returning the ID to the original party, while additional access will mean selecting the option in the Access section. Some crew members will ask for gimmick titles and you can decide to amuse these by clicking custom under the assignment section and writing in the title. If a crew member comes to your line missing their ID, you have a box or two of blank IDs in your locker. Put in their name and previous job and hand them this ID. If they’re missing their PDA, you have a box of these as well and can repaint them to match their job in the PDA painter. Inserting an ID into a PDA and updating its info will give ownership to the ID name, you can use this for sending secret messages or pretending to be another crew member (be sure to be following the servers rules of course).

When handing out additional access or assigning crew members to a department you don’t oversee, use both your brain and call the head of whichever department that would be affected by this change in access over the command channel for permission. Handing out maintenance access isn’t a big deal, but giving some schmuck access to security and the armoury, is.

**If you’re found to be detrimental with this role, be it by going over other heads and giving access out like free candy to anyone that asks, you can expect IC arrests and demotion, as well as being PMd by an admin. Continued abuse of the role will see you banned from HoP and possibly other head roles.**

#Who Said We Didn’t Need Fifty Clown Slots?

Another portion of your job is opening and closing job slots as crew die, or get shuffled into new roles. This can be accomplished by again, placing your ID into the console and opening up the second option. Here you can open more slots, or close ones that are unnecessary. As well, you can place jobs on high priority to denote a need for a specific role. Having more officers and chaplains than assistants during a shift with a ton of cultists is always a good thing. You can also allow the station to be blessed with more clowns, but know some crew might find this demotion worthy.

#I Starscream, Will Be the Leader Now!

If you find no captain is around shift start, or if one happens to disappear and with all effort can’t be brought back, it is finally time ... for you and the other heads of staff to have a meeting to decide the next to be Acting Captain. While chain of command is not a followed policy here, you are normally expected to take up the mantle of AC. If choosing the next captain becomes difficult, as in the CMO and RD are planning an all out war for the title or no one wants it, a message to Central Command at a communications console should be considered.

Now that everyone is in agreement, you can retrieve the spare ID, the nuke disk, and a captains headset from their office (or help the now acting captain in this regard) by upgrading your ID to captains access. An acting captain is expected to: hold onto the nuclear Authentication Disk, make executive decisions (shuttle calls/calling ERTs/assisting in departments missing a head of staff), and final say on executions and borgings. *Do not: meddle in departments with competent heads of staff, wear clothing that makes you look like the captain, arm yourself beyond your locker’s original contents without proof you are in danger.*

##The Station is On Fire and The Crew Want My Head
Revolutionaries? You’re first in line normally for decapitation. But don’t fret, a resourceful HoP can be ready for any situation. You have the ability of making fake identities and hiding among the riffraff, just know a mask and an ID do not change the sound of your voice. Be sure to work with the other heads and security, each can make or break the revolution from them dying and revs having access to your office, or keeping an eye on your back.
