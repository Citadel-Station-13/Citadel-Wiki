## Supply crates!
![Gray cargo crate](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/vWBJ6KFw0IQcEAHfHPnP2KB5mljVE7Rd8l69Sb2hWuaxD2cYiTiQ-nxB08SZIgtufhHqYg=s85 "Basic Cargo Crate") ![Closed Gray cargo crate](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661373537461993474/661373554880675879/unknown.png "Closed Basic Cargo Crate")

Crates are containers for items. Especially large items (Such as lockers, certain robots or equipment) cannot fit inside. Just because an item comes packed in a crate when the Quartermaster receives it doesn't mean it will go back inside once the crate is opened!

Supply Crates are ordered at Cargo Bay by either a Cargo Technician or the Quartermaster. You can also send them a request via PDA or the Requests Console. More crates can be found around the station.

## Ordering Crates
The Cargo Crew can order a whole lot of crates and usually wants the crate back after you've taken your supplies. They are worth a certain amount of points which can be used to get more supplies for the station's whole benefit. Cargo Techs like it when people bring crates, and will often give things without hassle to people with crates brought in.

## Crate Locks and Access
Just like the rest of the station, crates have variable levels of access. Security crates can be opened by security personnel and those with higher access, et cetera. An emag can get into locked crates, however, or you can get resourceful. Buying a crate will almost always tell you what access it needs when your buying it.

## The cargo consoles
![What the consoles looks like!](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/661373537461993474/661429881372147748/unknown.png "Each console")

Cargo has quite a few consoles, Request Order Console, Ordering Console, Bounty Console, Drop Pod Console.
The Order consoles can be hacked with a multitool to unlock some contrand crates that are less then legal. Or can be emagged to give you antag gear and other goodies! Hacking the consoles also allows you to sell more items, such as skins or feline body parts.

The Drop Pod or Express console can have an upgrade printed at the cargo protolathe to have more packs, but can not be hacked with a multitool. The Exspress console on the other hand has packets that are only able to be gotten with it.

The bounty console shows you items that CC wants and how many. These are good for getting money or items from other departments.

## Order Up!

Cargo budget starts off with 5,000 credits, and a passive income of 750 credits every minute. This is the budget you use to buy crates, and this is where money from exports ends up. You can also insert space cash into the bank machine in the vault to make it go directly into the cargo budget. The Quartermaster can enter the vault by using the supply door remote, found in the QM's locker.
